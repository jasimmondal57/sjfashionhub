# WhatsApp Marketing Template Guidelines

## üéØ **CRITICAL: Variable Samples Are REQUIRED!**

**‚ö†Ô∏è THIS IS WHY YOUR TEMPLATES WERE REJECTED!**

WhatsApp/Meta **REQUIRES** example values for ALL variables ({{1}}, {{2}}, {{3}}, etc.) to review your template.

**Without variable samples, your template will be automatically REJECTED.**

### **How to Provide Variable Samples:**

When creating a template with variables:
1. The form will automatically detect variables in your header and body
2. A "Variable Sample Values" section will appear
3. **You MUST fill in realistic example values for each variable**
4. Use realistic examples, NOT real customer data

**Example:**
- Variable {{1}} = "Priya Sharma" (NOT "John123" or real customer name)
- Variable {{2}} = "#SJF12345" (NOT actual order number)
- Variable {{3}} = "March 15, 2025" (NOT today's date)
