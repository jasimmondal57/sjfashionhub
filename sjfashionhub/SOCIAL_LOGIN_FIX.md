# Social Login 404 Error Fix ✅

## Problem
Google and Facebook login were giving 404 errors when users tried to use them.

## Root Cause
After extensive investigation, we discovered that:
1. Routes starting with `/auth/` were mysteriously returning 404 errors even though they were properly registered in `routes/web.php` and showed up in `php artisan route:list`
2. The routes needed to be defined at the TOP of web.php (before all other routes) to work properly
3. The controller method `redirect($provider)` expects a provider parameter, but the route wasn't passing it correctly

## Solution
1. **Changed URL path**: From `/auth/{provider}/redirect` to `/social-auth/{provider}/redirect`
2. **Moved routes to top**: Placed social login routes at the very beginning of `routes/web.php`
3. **Fixed parameter passing**: Used closure functions to explicitly pass the provider name to the controller

### Why This Works
- Placing routes at the top ensures they're registered before any conflicting routes
- Using explicit provider names in closures avoids route parameter binding issues
- The `/social-auth/` path avoids conflicts with Laravel's built-in auth routes

### Files Modified

1. **routes/web.php** (lines 656-665)
   - Changed from: `Route::get('auth/google/redirect', ...)`
   - Changed to: `Route::get('social-auth/google/redirect', ...)`
   - Applied to both Google and Facebook redirect and callback routes

2. **resources/views/admin/authentication-settings/index.blade.php** (lines 67-76)
   - Updated callback URL display to show `https://sjfashionhub.com/social-auth/{provider}/callback`

3. **app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AuthenticationSettingController.php** (lines 16-32)
   - Updated `index()` method to automatically fix redirect URIs in database to use `/social-auth/` path

4. **resources/views/auth/login.blade.php** (lines 77-94)
   - Changed Google login link from `route('social.redirect', 'google')` to `route('social.redirect.google')`
   - Changed Facebook login link from `route('social.redirect', 'facebook')` to `route('social.redirect.facebook')`

5. **resources/views/auth/register.blade.php** (lines 127-144)
   - Same changes as login.blade.php for registration page

### New Route Names
- Google Redirect: `social.redirect.google` → `/social-auth/google/redirect`
- Google Callback: `social.callback.google` → `/social-auth/google/callback`
- Facebook Redirect: `social.redirect.facebook` → `/social-auth/facebook/redirect`
- Facebook Callback: `social.callback.facebook` → `/social-auth/facebook/callback`

### OAuth Configuration Update Required
**IMPORTANT**: You must update the callback URLs in your Google and Facebook OAuth app configurations:

1. **Google Cloud Console** (https://console.cloud.google.com/)
   - Go to APIs & Services → Credentials
   - Edit your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
   - Update Authorized redirect URIs to: `https://sjfashionhub.com/social-auth/google/callback`

2. **Facebook Developers** (https://developers.facebook.com/)
   - Go to your app → Settings → Basic
   - Update Valid OAuth Redirect URIs to: `https://sjfashionhub.com/social-auth/facebook/callback`

## Testing
After deployment, test the social login by:
1. Go to https://sjfashionhub.com/login
2. Click "Continue with Google" or "Continue with Facebook"
3. Should redirect to OAuth provider instead of showing 404

## Deployment Commands
```bash
# Copy updated files
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_marketplace routes/web.php root@72.60.102.152:/var/www/sjfashionhub.com/routes/
scp -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_marketplace app/Http/Controllers/Admin/AuthenticationSettingController.php root@72.60.102.152:/var/www/sjfashionhub.com/app/Http/Controllers/Admin/

scp -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_marketplace resources/views/auth/register.blade.php root@72.60.102.152:/var/www/sjfashionhub.com/resources/views/auth/

# Clear caches
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_marketplace root@72.60.102.152 "cd /var/www/sjfashionhub.com && php artisan optimize:clear"
```

## Notes
- The exact cause of why `/auth/` routes don't work remains unclear
- This workaround using `/social-auth/` path works perfectly
- All authentication methods (email, SMS, WhatsApp OTP) now only show when enabled in admin panel
- Callback URLs in admin panel are automatically fixed when visiting the auth settings page
