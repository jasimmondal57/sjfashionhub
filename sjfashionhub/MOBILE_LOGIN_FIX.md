## 💡 Why This Change

**Better UX**: Users only see loading popup during the actual login process (OTP verification), not during OTP sending.

**Clear Feedback**: 
- "Sending..." text on button = OTP is being sent
- Loading popup = User is being logged in

**Consistent**: Matches the behavior of email login where loading popup appears during login, not during form validation.

---

## ✅ Status

**COMPLETE** - Mobile login loading popup timing fixed!

Users now see the loading popup at the correct time - when verifying OTP and logging in, not when sending OTP.
