## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Automatic Triggers:**

   - Sends WhatsApp message via `WhatsAppService`

2. **Order Status Changed:**
   - `OrderObserver::updated()` is triggered
   - Detects status change
   - Sends appropriate WhatsApp notification based on new status

### **Code Flow:**
```
Order Created/Updated
    ↓
OrderObserver (app/Observers/OrderObserver.php)
    ↓
EmailNotificationService (app/Services/EmailNotificationService.php)
    ↓
WhatsAppService (app/Services/WhatsAppService.php)
    ↓
WhatsApp Business API (Meta)
    ↓
Customer receives message
```
