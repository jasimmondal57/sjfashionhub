# ðŸ”§ Meta Pixel Event Tracking - Fixes Summary

## Problem
Meta Pixel was not receiving ADD_TO_CART and PURCHASE events, showing 0 events in Meta Business Suite.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **ADD_TO_CART events** - Not properly formatted or timing issues with fbq library
2. **PURCHASE events** - Not being tracked on success pages
3. **Missing global tracking functions** - No centralized way to track events
4. **Data type issues** - Product IDs and prices not properly converted to correct types

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Global Tracking Functions
**File:** `resources/views/components/layouts/main.blade.php`

Added 4 global JavaScript functions:
- `trackMetaPixelAddToCart()` - Track product additions to cart
- `trackMetaPixelPurchase()` - Track completed orders
- `trackMetaPixelViewContent()` - Track product views
- `trackMetaPixelInitiateCheckout()` - Track checkout initiation

**Benefits:**
- Centralized tracking logic
- Consistent data formatting
- Easy to debug with console logs
- Reusable across all pages

### 2. Fixed ADD_TO_CART Event Tracking
**File:** `resources/views/components/layouts/main.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Updated to use global `trackMetaPixelAddToCart()` function
- Proper data type conversion (String for IDs, parseFloat for prices)
- Added fallback to direct fbq call if function not available
- Added console logging for debugging

**Data Format:**
```javascript
{
  content_name: productName,
  content_category: category,
  content_ids: [String(productId)],
  content_type: 'product',
  value: parseFloat(price),
  currency: 'INR',
  contents: [{
    id: String(productId),
    quantity: 1,
    item_price: parseFloat(price)
  }]
}
```

### 3. Added PURCHASE Event Tracking
**Files:**
- `resources/views/checkout/success.blade.php`
- `resources/views/payment/success.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Added script to track purchase on success pages
- Waits 500ms for fbq to load
- Includes all order items with proper formatting
- Logs success to console

### 4. Added ViewContent Event Tracking
**File:** `resources/views/products/show.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Tracks when user views product details
- Includes product name, price, and category
- Fires on page load with 300ms delay

### 5. Added InitiateCheckout Event Tracking
**File:** `resources/views/checkout/index.blade.php`

**Changes:**
- Tracks when user proceeds to checkout
- Includes cart total and item count
- Includes all cart items with details

## Technical Details

### Data Type Conversions
- **Product IDs:** Converted to String for Meta Pixel compatibility
- **Prices:** Converted to parseFloat for numeric accuracy
- **Quantities:** Ensured as integers

### Event Timing
- ViewContent: 300ms delay after page load
- Purchase: 500ms delay to ensure fbq is loaded
- InitiateCheckout: 300ms delay after page load
- AddToCart: Immediate (fbq queues if not ready)

### Error Handling
- Checks if fbq is defined before tracking
- Fallback to direct fbq call if global function unavailable
- Console warnings if tracking fails
- Graceful degradation if pixel not configured

## Files Modified
1. `resources/views/components/layouts/main.blade.php` - Added global functions and improved AddToCart tracking
2. `resources/views/checkout/success.blade.php` - Added Purchase event tracking
3. `resources/views/payment/success.blade.php` - Added Purchase event tracking
4. `resources/views/products/show.blade.php` - Added ViewContent event tracking
5. `resources/views/checkout/index.blade.php` - Added InitiateCheckout event tracking

## Deployment

- Cache cleared on server
- Changes committed to git
