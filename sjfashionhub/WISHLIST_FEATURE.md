# Wishlist Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implemented complete wishlist functionality for sjfashionhub.com, allowing users to save their favorite products for later.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **Wishlist Controller** (`app/Http/Controllers/WishlistController.php`)
- **`index()`**: Display user's wishlist page
- **`add()`**: Add product to wishlist
- **`remove()`**: Remove product from wishlist
- **`toggle()`**: Toggle product in/out of wishlist (used by AJAX)

### 2. **Routes** (`routes/web.php`)
Added wishlist routes under `auth` middleware:
```php
Route::middleware('auth')->group(function () {
    Route::get('/wishlist', [WishlistController::class, 'index'])->name('wishlist.index');
    Route::post('/wishlist/add', [WishlistController::class, 'add'])->name('wishlist.add');
    Route::post('/wishlist/toggle', [WishlistController::class, 'toggle'])->name('wishlist.toggle');
    Route::delete('/wishlist/{wishlist}', [WishlistController::class, 'remove'])->name('wishlist.remove');
});
```

### 3. **Product Details Page** (`resources/views/products/show.blade.php`)
- Added wishlist button with heart icon
- Shows "In Wishlist" if product is already in wishlist (filled red heart)
- Shows "Add to Wishlist" if product is not in wishlist (outline heart)
- Clicking the button toggles wishlist status via AJAX
- Shows success/error notifications

**Features:**
