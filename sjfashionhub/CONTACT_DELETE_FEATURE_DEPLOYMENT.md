## Technical Details

### Route Order Fix
Routes are now defined in correct order:
```
POST  /admin/contacts/bulk-delete
POST  /admin/contacts/delete-all-messages
POST  /admin/contacts/delete-page-messages
GET   /admin/contacts (resource)
DELETE /admin/contacts/{contact} (resource)
```

This ensures custom routes are matched before the resource route.

### Validation
- Bulk delete validates IDs exist in database
- Page delete respects current filters
- All operations include CSRF protection

### Success Messages
- Individual delete: "Contact message deleted successfully."
- Bulk delete: "Successfully deleted X contact message(s)."
- Page delete: "Successfully deleted X contact message(s) from this page."
- Delete all: "Successfully deleted all X contact message(s)."
