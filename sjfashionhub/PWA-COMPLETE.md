## 🎨 IMPORTANT: Generate Icons

**You need to generate and upload PWA icons!**

### Quick Steps:

1. **Open Icon Generator:**
   ```
   https://sjfashionhub.com/generate-pwa-icons.html
   ```

2. **Download All Icons:**
   - Click "OK" when prompted
   - 8 icons will download automatically
   - Or click individual download buttons

3. **Upload to Server:**
   ```bash
   scp -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_marketplace icon-*.png root@72.60.102.152:/var/www/sjfashionhub.com/public/images/pwa/
   ```

**Until icons are uploaded, you'll see broken image icons. The PWA will still work, but icons won't display properly.**
