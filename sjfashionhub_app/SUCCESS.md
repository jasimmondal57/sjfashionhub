## 📱 App is Now Installed On Your Device!

**Package Name:** `com.sjfashionhub.app`  
**APK Location:** `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

---

## 🔧 The Key Fix

**Problem:** Gradle was using Java 11, but Android Gradle Plugin 8.1.4 requires Java 17+

**Solution:** Created `android/gradle.properties` with:
```properties
org.gradle.java.home=C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-19
```

This told Gradle to use Java 19 instead of Java 11.
