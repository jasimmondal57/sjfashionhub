## Fixes Applied

### 1. ‚úÖ Fixed Home Page Blank Issue

**Problem:** The home screen was blank because the API response format changed. The backend now returns data in a `sections` array format instead of direct `banners`, `categories`, `featured_products`, `new_arrivals` keys.

**Solution:** Updated `lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart` to parse the new API format:

```dart
// Parse sections from new API format
final sections = data['sections'] as List? ?? [];

for (var section in sections) {
  final type = section['type'] as String?;
  final items = section['items'] as List? ?? [];
  
  switch (type) {
    case 'banner':
      _banners = List<Map<String, dynamic>>.from(items);
      break;
    case 'category':
      _categories = List<Map<String, dynamic>>.from(items);
      break;
    case 'featured':
      _featuredProducts = List<Map<String, dynamic>>.from(items);
      break;
    case 'product_grid':
      if (section['config']?['filter'] == 'new') {
        _newArrivals = List<Map<String, dynamic>>.from(items);
      }
      break;
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart` (lines 29-71)

---

### 2. ‚úÖ Fixed Product Images Not Showing

**Problem:** Products have `"image": null` in the API response, but they have an `"images": [...]` array with actual image URLs. The app was only checking the `image` field.

**Solution:** Updated all product card widgets to use the first image from the `images` array if the `image` field is null:

```dart
// Get product image - use first image from images array if image is null
String? imageUrl = product['image'];
if (imageUrl == null || imageUrl.isEmpty) {
  final images = product['images'] as List?;
  if (images != null && images.isNotEmpty) {
    imageUrl = images[0];
  }
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart` - `_buildProductCard()` method
- `lib/screens/products/products_screen.dart` - `_buildProductGridCard()` method
- `lib/screens/products/products_screen.dart` - `_buildProductListCard()` method

---

### 3. ‚úÖ Removed Carousel Package Conflict

**Problem:** The `carousel_slider` package was conflicting with Flutter 3.22.3's built-in carousel component.

**Solution:** 
- Replaced `CarouselSlider` with native Flutter `PageView` widget
- Removed `carousel_slider` package from `pubspec.yaml`

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/home/home_screen.dart` - Replaced CarouselSlider with PageView for banners
- `lib/screens/products/product_detail_screen.dart` - Replaced CarouselSlider with PageView for product images
- `pubspec.yaml` - Removed carousel_slider dependency

---

### 4. ‚úÖ Fixed Bottom Navigation Not Showing

**Problem:** Users couldn't see the bottom navigation bar because the app required authentication to access the main screen with navigation.

**Solution:** Added a "Continue as Guest" button on the login screen that allows users to browse the app without logging in.

```dart
// Continue as Guest
TextButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.pushReplacement(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(builder: (_) => const MainScreen()),
    );
  },
  child: const Text(
    'Continue as Guest',
    style: TextStyle(
      color: Colors.grey,
      decoration: TextDecoration.underline,
    ),
  ),
),
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/auth/login_screen_new.dart` - Added guest mode button

**User Action Required:** Click "Continue as Guest" on the login screen to access the app without authentication.

---

### 5. ‚úÖ Fixed Product Details Not Showing

**Problem:** The product detail screen was blank because the API returns product data wrapped in a `"product"` key, but the screen expected the data directly.

**API Response:**
```json
{
  "product": {
    "id": 9,
    "name": "Product Name",
    "description": "...",
    ...
  }
}
```

**Solution:** Updated the `getProduct()` method in API service to extract the product data from the wrapper:

```dart
Future<Map<String, dynamic>> getProduct(int id) async {
  final response = await get('${ApiConfig.productsEndpoint}/$id');
  return response['product'] ?? response;
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/services/api_service.dart` - Updated `getProduct()` method
- `lib/screens/products/product_detail_screen.dart` - Added error logging

---

## Issues Still Remaining

### 1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Category Filter Not Working (Backend Issue)

**Problem:** When filtering products by category (e.g., `category_id=22`), the API returns products from multiple categories, not just the requested category.

**Example:**
```bash
curl "https://sjfashionhub.com/api/mobile/products?category_id=22"
```

Returns products with:
- `"category":{"id":22,"name":"2 Pcs Set"}` ‚úÖ Correct
- `"category":{"id":23,"name":"3 Pcs Set"}` ‚ùå Wrong - should not be included

**Root Cause:** The backend API endpoint `/api/mobile/products` is not properly filtering by `category_id`.

**Solution Needed:** Fix the backend Laravel controller to properly filter products by category_id.

**Backend File to Check:** 
- `app/Http/Controllers/Api/Mobile/ProductController.php` or similar
- Look for the `index()` or `getProducts()` method
- Ensure the query includes: `->where('category_id', $request->category_id)`

**Status:** Fixed! The product detail screen now shows all information correctly.
